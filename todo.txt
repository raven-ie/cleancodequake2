Possible current version
- Remove usage of GetModelIndex() == 255. This is stupid.
- Remove usage of level.current_entity
- Print buffer for each player & for console (shove all prints into buffer then print them at the end of the frame)

Future versions
- A scripting system to replace entities like func_timer, etc.
  - I'll go more in-depth on this after CleanCode's first release, with a design doc explaining it.
- Private entity. Ran into some problems with a few functions from this (anything gameEntity related) but
I'll take another crack at it sometime.
- The "CleanCode Enhancements". Basically a list of enhancements to the game that don't require
a special engine; they will work with any Q2 engine. The idea is on the table but unsure of
how or what's going into it. A must would be voice chat, but besides that, we're not sure yet.
You could run an exe that responds to hotkeys that tell it when to check the server for
CCE support, or have an engine that supports CCE built right in, which probably won't be
many.
- A "smart entity" feature (single player/coop only) where entities in areas not yet explored (entities being
anything that doesn't do anything; items, weapons, certain doors and platforms) are pushed in a special list
and a temporary trigger is spawned in an area deemed "the beginning" of an area. Once the trigger is touched, the
entities that were stored away will be spawned. This won't lower overflows since it's out of your PVS, however this
could speed up gameplay since you're only acting on entities that you can physically be near.
