Description:

sircl is an irc library in C. The major features are small size and
portability. sircl can be used to program interactive or no 
interactive irc clients, for example chats programs, irc bots, etc.

Target (2004):

sircl is a small and portable irc library. Portable irc libraries exist,
but in java. I wanted (and didn't find) a library to make small irc
programs, so I decided to program my own library in C. This irc
library is full rfc1459(irc protocol) compliant, and it works fine
by now. The basic functions are implemented and the next target of
the project is program ctcp and DCC operations.
