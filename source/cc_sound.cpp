==================
SV_StartSound

Each entity can have eight independant sound sources, like voice,
weapon, feet, etc.

If channel & 8, the sound will be sent to everyone, not just
things in the PHS.

FIXME: if entity isn't in PHS, they must be forced to be sent or
have the origin explicitly sent.

Channel 0 is an auto-allocate channel, the others override anything
already running on that entity/channel pair.

An attenuation of 0 will play full volume everywhere in the level.
Larger attenuations will drop off.  (max 4 attenuation)

timeOffset can range from 0.0 to 0.1 to cause sounds to be started
later in the frame than they normally would.

If origin is NULL, the origin is determined from the entity origin
or the midpoint of the entity box for bmodels.
